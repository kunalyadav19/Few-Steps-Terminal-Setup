## **6 Set Up Starship in Your Shell**

To ensure Starship is loaded every time you open a terminal, add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, or .bash_profile):

```bash
eval "$(starship init bash)"  # For Bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"   # For Zsh
eval "$(starship init fish)"  # For Fish ```
Replace bash, zsh, or fish with your shell of choice.

After updating your shell configuration file, reload it to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash
source ~/.zshrc   # For Zsh
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish  # For Fish
